The Data Science team is collating all of its resources it has available across multiple platforms into one location. At present this only has to be a very basic collection stating what we have and where.
As a first step, we can collect links to all our resources into one document here. We want to know, for each resource:
* What is the purpose of the resource?
* Where is the guidance saved?
* Comments about the resource as it stands – is it relevant, does it need updating, etc.?
* Is the resource relevant to the community, should it be included in the final Wiki?
* What actions are associated with this resource?
* Are there better resources elsewhere?

In the document linked above, please create a new sheet for the folder/ area mentioned in the ticket title, and examine all documents contained in this area, filling out the template on the “Info” page.
